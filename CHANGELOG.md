# Changelog

## 1.1.0

### Features

- ``APPLY_RESOLVER_TO_CONST_OBJECT`` and ``APPLY_RESOLVER_WITH_PARAMS_TO_CONST_OBJECT`` macros added to allow applying a Resolver to a const object. The need for separate macros is due to some problems with **[gcc on linux](https://travis-ci.org/Donerkebap13/DonerSerializer/jobs/414179203)**.
